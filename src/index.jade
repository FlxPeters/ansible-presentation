                ul.bullet
                    li Ansible is an open-source software platform for configuring and managing computers.
                    li Founded by Michael DeHaan
                    li First release February 20, 2012 - 3 years ago
                    li Written in python
                    li It runs over SSH or PowerShell
                    li It was named "Ansible" after the fictional instantaneous hyperspace communication system featured in Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game, and originally invented by Ursula K. Le Guin for her 1966 novel Rocannon's World.

                h2 Michael DeHaan's motivation?
                h3 "I wrote Ansible because none of the existing tools fit my brain. I wanted a tool that I could not use for 6 months, come back later, and still remember how it worked."
